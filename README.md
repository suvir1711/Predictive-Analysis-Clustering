# Clustering using PyCaret

This project utilizes PyCaret to explore and compare various clustering algorithms applied to the Seeds Dataset.

### Metrics Utilized

1. **Silhouette Score**: This metric gauges how well data points are assigned to their respective clusters by considering both intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster dissimilarity. Its scale ranges from -1 to 1, with higher scores indicating better clustering.

2. **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: This index assesses the ratio of between-cluster distance to within-cluster distance. Higher values signify better separation between clusters.

3. **Davies-Bouldin Index**: This index measures the ratio of within-cluster distance to between-cluster distance. Lower values indicate tighter and better-separated clusters.
